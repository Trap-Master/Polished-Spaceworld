# Polished Spaceworld

This is something I've been working on a long time and had many roadblocks along the way. Something being close to three years on various engines. Anyway its loosely based on the spaceworld 97 demo. Using the same map and the Nihon region which is just Pokejapan. I used Polished Crystal due to all its features like abiities and Rangi just made the PC graphics look super sexy. Its still very much A WIP and like most things it implodes a lot but I wil keep trying even if it takes me years.


## Features

These came free with using the PC engine as a base

* 253 Pokémon, including some new evolutions.
* 48 new moves.
* 65 TMs and 21 move tutors.
* Many new mechanics, including the Fairy type, Physical/Special split, Natures, unlimited TMs, Running Shoes, and continuous Repel.
* Music and graphics devamped from other versions.
* Nuzlocke mode in the Option menu, enabling the basic rules of the [Nuzlocke Challenge](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nuzlocke_Challenge).
